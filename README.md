- Write a function that takes two lists and returns a new list containing the elements that are in both lists (intersection).

## Lists
- Write a program that removes all duplicate items from a list.
- Write a program that sorts a list of numbers in descending order.
- Write a program that finds the second-largest number in a list. 

## Tuples
- Write a program that checks if a tuple contains a specific element.
- Write a program that iterates over a tuple and prints the index and value of each element.
- Write a program that concatenates two tuples.

## String
- Write a program that counts the number of occurrences of a specific character in a string.
- Write a program that reverses a string.
